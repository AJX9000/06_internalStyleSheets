        </h1>

        <h2>
            A place I would like to visit.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?
        </p>
        <ol> <!-- Ordered list of places that I want to visit, from most wanted to least.-->
            <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Singapore</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Germany</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I guess it would be Seattle, Washington. I never went there (no, the airport doesn't count), but I hear that it's a very lively and large city.
            It houses tons of services such as restaurants and tech shops, a lot of big companies such as Microsoft, and many prospective people my age with a
            vast variety of interests - video games, music genres, TV shows, and so forth. Of course, I can't mention Seattle without the Space Needle, an attraction that
            looks futuristic, even today. I hear that it's not just a marvel on the outside; some fancy restaurants within the tower serve food with a grand view of the city. Some fancy
            spaghetti in one of the cores of the future - is that not cool?
        </p>
        <p>
            Just look at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle">marvel in architecture, brought to you by Wikipedia.</a>

        <h2>
            A person that I admire<br>(past or present)
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sonic the Hedgehog</li>
            <li>Yoda</li>
            <li>Kurt Cobain</li>
            <li>Bill Gates</li>
            <li>My middle school crush</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My idol <i>was</i> Sonic the Hedgehog because he was cool with attitude, and he let nothing change the very cool attitude that made Sonic who he is.

            A prime example of this can be seen in the animated TV series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKDXi9FUWRZK9PAfAJ9QV-2bEPVURX3Ed" target="_blank">Sonic X (I know, I know, 4Kids).</a>
